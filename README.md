# hello-world 
  
  Hi everyone,
  
  Yujing here! I just finished my first year of undergrad at McGill University in Life Sciences. 
  
  Currently I am going through some transition stage as I have just discovered that I am more of a physical science person than life science... Now that it is summer now, I am ready to devote a lot of time to learn how to code...for fun!! Yayy
